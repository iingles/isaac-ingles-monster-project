**My five changes**

* Instead of creating seperate 'damage' methods for each button, I created only one damage method that assesses the damage with each turn

* I used two arrays instead of one for the log

* I wrapped my project in Vuetify elements

* I separated my project into several different components

* I used modal windows instead of 'confirm' dialogs
